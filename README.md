# CLI PDF to PNG converter

If running for the first time ensure you have [python](https://www.python.org/)

Although I recommend not using basekit python but instead virtual environment like [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)

run:
```bash
pip install pdf2image pillow
```
or
```bash
conda install pdf2image pillow
```

---

Then put you PDF to the root and call this:

```bash
python converter.py <name of your PDF file>
```

Have fun <3
